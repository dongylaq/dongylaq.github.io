Asymptotic analysis of quantum algorithms based on QSP has shown that asymptotically optimal results can in principle be obtained for a range of tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation and the quantum linear system problem.  A further benefit of QSP is that it uses a minimal number of ancilla qubits, which facilitates its implementation on near-to-intermediate term quantum architectures. However, there is so far no classically stable algorithm allowing computation of the phase factors that are needed to build QSP circuits. Existing methods require the usage of variable precision arithmetic and can only be applied to polynomials of relatively low degree. We present here an optimization based method that can accurately compute the phase factors using standard double precision arithmetic operations. We demonstrate the performance of this approach with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, eigenvalue filtering, and the quantum linear system problems. Our numerical results show that the optimization algorithm can find phase factors to accurately approximate polynomials of degree larger than "),a("span",{staticClass:"katex"},[a("span",{staticClass:"katex-mathml"},[a("math",[a("semantics",[a("mrow",[a("mn",[t._v("1")]),a("mn",[t._v("0")]),a("mn",[t._v("0")]),a("mn",[t._v("0")]),a("mn",[t._v("0")])],1),a("annotation",{attrs:{encoding:"application/x-tex"}},[t._v("10000")])],1)],1)],1),a("span",{staticClass:"katex-html",attrs:{"aria-hidden":"true"}},[a("span",{staticClass:"strut",staticStyle:{height:"0.64444em"}}),a("span",{staticClass:"strut bottom",staticStyle:{height:"0.64444em","vertical-align":"0em"}}),a("span",{staticClass:"base textstyle uncramped"},[a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("1")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("0")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("0")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("0")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("0")])])])]),t._v(" with error below "),a("span",{staticClass:"katex"},[a("span",{staticClass:"katex-mathml"},[a("math",[a("semantics",[a("mrow",[a("mn",[t._v("1")]),a("msup",[a("mn",[t._v("0")]),a("mrow",[a("mo",[t._v("−")]),a("mn",[t._v("1")]),a("mn",[t._v("2")])],1)],1)],1),a("annotation",{attrs:{encoding:"application/x-tex"}},[t._v("10^{-12}")])],1)],1)],1),a("span",{staticClass:"katex-html",attrs:{"aria-hidden":"true"}},[a("span",{staticClass:"strut",staticStyle:{height:"0.8141079999999999em"}}),a("span",{staticClass:"strut bottom",staticStyle:{height:"0.8141079999999999em","vertical-align":"0em"}}),a("span",{staticClass:"base textstyle uncramped"},[a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("1")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord"},[a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("0")]),a("span",{staticClass:"vlist"},[a("span",{staticStyle:{top:"-0.363em","margin-right":"0.05em"}},[a("span",{staticClass:"fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"},[a("span",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"0em"}},[t._v("​")])]),a("span",{staticClass:"reset-textstyle scriptstyle uncramped"},[a("span",{staticClass:"mord scriptstyle uncramped"},[a("span",{staticClass:"mord"},[t._v("−")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("1")]),a("span",{staticClass:"mord mathrm"},[t._v("2")])])])]),a("span",{staticClass:"baseline-fix"},[a("span",{staticClass:"fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"},[a("span",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"0em"}},[t._v("​")])]),t._v("​")])])])])])]),t._v(".")]),t._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[t._v("Investigated symmetries in the QSP model and reduced the numerical complexity of finding QSP phase factors.")]),t._v(" "),a("li",[t._v("Derived asymptotic bounds connecting QSP phase factors and the Chebyshev coefficients of target functions.")]),t._v(" "),a("li",[t._v("Proposed an optimization-based algorithm which enabled the robustness in solving QSP phase factors with double precision.")])])]),t._v(" "),a("ProjectCard",[a("h2",{attrs:{id:"random-circuit-block-encoded-matrix-and-a-proposal-of-quantum-linpack-benchmark"}},[t._v("Random circuit block-encoded matrix and a proposal of quantum LINPACK benchmark")]),t._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[a("strong",[t._v("Yulong Dong")]),t._v(", Lin Lin.

We propose an input model called the RAndom Circuit Block-Encoded Matrix (RACBEM), which is a proper generalization of a dense random matrix in the quantum setting. The RACBEM model is efficient to be implemented on a quantum computer, and can be designed to optimally adapt to any given quantum architecture, with relying on a black-box quantum compiler. The task of the quantum LINPACK benchmark can also be difficult for classical computers, and its success can pave the way for achieving quantum advantage. Besides solving linear systems, the RACBEM model can be used to perform a variety of linear algebra tasks, such as computing spectral measures, time series generated by a Hamiltonian simulation, and thermal averages of the energy.
